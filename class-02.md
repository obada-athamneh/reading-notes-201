# Headings
## <h1>
## <h2>
## <h3>
## <h4>
## <h5>
## <h6>

* HTML has six "levels" of
headings:
<h1> is used for main headings
<h2> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
<h3> element is used, and so
on...

# Paragraphs
## <p>

* To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag.

# Bold & Italic
* <b>
By enclosing words in the tags
<b> and </b> we can make
characters appear bold.

## <i>
* By enclosing words in the tags
<i> and </i> we can make
characters appear italic.

# Superscript & Subscrip
## <sup>
* The <sup> element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 22
.
## <sub>
* The <sub> element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H2
0.

# Visual Editors &
Their Code views

* Visual editors often resemble
word processors. Although
each editor will differ slightly,
there are some features that
are common to most editors
that allow you to control the
presentation of text.

* Code views show you the code
created by the visual editor so
you can manually edit it, or so
you can just enter new code
yourself

## CSS Associates Style
rules with HTML
elements
### CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

p {
 font-family: Arial;}
Selector
* Selectors indicate which
element the rule applies to.
The same rule can apply to
more than one element if you
separate the element names
with commas.
Declarations indicate how
the elements referred to in
the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two
parts (a property and a value),
and are separated by a colon.

## CSS Properties Affect
How Elements Are
Displayed
### CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

 # java script
 ## STATEMENTS
 * A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

## COMMENTS 
* You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 

## WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
* A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables. 

## DATA TYPES 
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Booleans.

1. EVALUATIONS
You can analyze values in
your scripts to determine
whether or note they
match expected results. 
2. DECISIONS
Using the results of
evaluations, you can
decide which path your
script should go down.
3. LOOPS
There are also many
occasions where you will
want to perform the same
set of steps repeatedly. 

## USING
COMPARISON OPERATORS 

* At the most basic level, you can
evaluate two variables using a
comparison operator to return a
t rue or f al se value.
