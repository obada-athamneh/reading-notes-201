# Links 
*  The defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

## You will commonly come across the following types of links:

1.  Links from one website to another
2.  Links from one page to another on the same website
3. Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
4. Links that open in a new browser window
5. Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone

## Writing Links

* Links are created using the a element. Users can click on anything
between the opening a tag and the closing /a tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

# Directory Structure

* On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the
pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a
website are sometimes referred to as directories.

1. Structure
2. Relationships
3. Homepages

# Relative URLs

* Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.

# Layout

* This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be
different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this
chapter we will:

1. Explore different ways to position elements using normal
flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
2. Discover how various devices have different screen sizes
and resolution, and how this affects the design process.
3. Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts,
and how they are created.
4. Find out how designers use grids to make their page
designs look more professional.

### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

1. Building Blocks
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

2. Containing Elements
* If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element

## Controlling the Position of Elements

* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

1. Normal flow
2. Relative Positioning
3. Absolute positioning


# Functions Methods and Objects

* Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce: 

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

## VARIABLE SCOPE

* The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

* Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character? You can, with pair programming, a technique common to many agile work environments.
