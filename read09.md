# Forms

* Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.

* Whether you are adding a simple search box to your website or
you need to create more complicated insurance applications,
HTML forms give you a set of elements to collect data from
your users. In this chapter you will learn:
1. How to create a form on your website
2. The different tools for collecting data
3. New HTML5 form controls

## Why Forms?

* The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage.

### Form Controls

* How Forms Work

# Lists, Tables and Forms

* There are several CSS properties that
were created to work with specific types
of HTML elements, such as lists, tables,
and forms.

## In this chapter you will learn how to:
1. Specify the type of bullet point or numbering on lists
2. Add borders and backgrounds to table cells
3. Control the appearance of form controls

# Events

* W hen you browse the web, your browser registers different
types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this
just happened." Your script can then respond to these events. 

* Scripts often respond to these events by updating the content of the web page (via the
Document Object Model) which makes the page feel more interactive. In this chapter, you
will learn how: 

1. INTERACTIONS CREATE EVENTS
2. EVENTS TRIGGER CODE 
3. CODE RESPONDS TO USERS 

## HOW EVENTS TRIGGER JAVASCRIPT CODE 

* When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three
steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code.
Together these steps are known as event handling

1. Select t he element
node(s) you want the
script to respond to. 
2.  Indicate which event on
the selected node(s) will
trigger the response
3. State the code you want
to run when the event
occurs.
