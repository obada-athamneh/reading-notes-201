# WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 
* Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names. 

## CREATINGÂ· OBJECTS USING LITERAL NOTATION 

### This example starts by creating
an object using literal notation.
This object is called hotel which
represents a hotel called Quay
with 40 rooms (25 of which have
been booked). 


## CREATING MORE OBJECT LITERALS

* Here you can see another object.
Again it is called hote 1, but this
time the model represents a
different hotel. For a moment,
imagine that this is a different
page of the same travel website.

# Document object model

* The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

## THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE 

* As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.
The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.
It consists of four main types of nodes. 

## DOM TREE 

1. ATTRIBUTE NODES
2. TEXT NODES 

## WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE 

* Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.

## STEP 1: ACCESS THE ELEMENTS
## STEP 2: WORK W ITH THOSE ELEMENTS 

## ACCESSING ELEMENTS 

* DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist,
which is a collection of nodes. 

## NODELISTS: DOM QUERIES THAT RETURN MORE THAN ONE ELEMENT 

* When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a
Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element). 

## LOOPING THROUGH A NODELIST

## CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) ATTACKS 

* If you add HTML to a page using i nnerHTML (or several jQuery methods),
you need to be aware of Cross-Site Scripting Attacks or XSS; otherwise,
an attacker could gain access to your users' accounts.
