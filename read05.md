# Images

* There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart.

1. Include an image in your web pages using HTML
2. Pick which image format to use
3. Show an image at the right size
4. Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages
load faster

## Choosing Images for Your Site
* A picture can say a thousand words, and great
images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one

* Images can be used to set the
tone for a site in less time than
it takes to read a description

### Storing Images on Your Site
* If you are building a site from scratch, it is good
practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.

## Three Rules for Creating Images

1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution

## Tools to Edit & Save Images

* There are several tools you can use to edit and
save images to ensure that they are the right
size, format, and resolution.

### Image Dimensions
* The images you use on your website should be
saved at the same width and height that you
want them to appear on the page.

### Cropping Images
* When cropping images it is important not to
lose valuable information. It is best to source
images that are the correct shape if possible

### Image Resolution
* Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file

### Vector Images
* Vector images differ from bitmap images and
are resolution-independent. Vector images are
commonly created in programs such as Adobe
Illustrator.

# Color

* Color can really bring your pages to life.

## In this chapter we will look at:

 1. How to specify colors, as there are three common ways in
which you can indicate your choice of colors (plus extra
ways made available in CSS3)
2. Color terminology, as there are some terms that are very
helpful to understand when it comes to picking colors
3. Contrast, and ensuring that your text is readable
4. Background colors for behind either your entire page or
parts of a page

## Understanding Color

* Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

## Contrast
* When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

### Low Contrast
### High Contrast
### Medium Contrast

## CSS3: HSL Colors
* CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values.

# Text

* The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:

1. Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text)
2. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)

## Typeface Terminology

* Serif
Serif fonts have extra details on
the ends of the main strokes of
the letters. These details are
known as serifs.

* Sans-Serif
Sans-serif fonts have straight
ends to letters, and therefore
have a much cleaner design.

* Monospace
Every letter in a monospace (or
fixed-width) font is the same
width. (Non-monospace fonts
have different widths.)
