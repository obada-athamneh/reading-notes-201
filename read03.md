# There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types

1. Ordered lists

* are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.


2. Unordered lists
* are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order)


3. Definition lists
* are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.


# At the beginning of this section on CSS,
you saw how CSS treats each HTML
element as if it lives in its own box.

* You can set several properties that affect the appearance of
these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:

1. Control the dimensions of your boxes
2. Create borders around boxes
3. Set margins and padding for boxes
4. Show and hide boxes

## Border, Margin & Padding

1. Border
2. Margin
3. Padding

## White space & Vertical Margin

# USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS
* Here you can see that an
if ... e 1 se statement allows you
to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition
evaluates to true
2. another set if the condition is
false 

## SWITCH STATEMENTS

* A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value. 

## TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES 

* Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript
can be treated as if it were true or false; and
this has some interesting side effects. 

## SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES 

* Logical operators are processed left to right.
They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a
result - but they return the value that stopped
the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1 se)

## FOR LOOPS

### A for loop is often used to loop
through the items in an array. 

## WHILE LOOPS 

## DO WHILE LOOPS
