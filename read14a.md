# Transforms

* With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

* The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

## Transform Syntax

* The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

### 2D Transforms

* Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. We’ll start by discussing how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.


# Transitions & Animations

* One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.


## Transitions

* As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

# Here are 8 really simple effects that will add life to your UI and smiles to your users’ faces.

1. Fade in
* Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.


2. Change color
* Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them. Now, we just set the div’s class to “color” and specify the color we want in our CSS


3. Grow & Shrink
* To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding. But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge.


4. Rotate elements
* CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element. Give your div the class “rotate” and add the following to your CSS


5. Square to circle
* A really popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa. With CSS, it’s a simple effect to achieve, we just transition the border-radius property.


6. 3D shadow
* 3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design, which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces.


7. Swing
* Not all elements use the transition property. We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.


8. Inset border
* One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border. We can of course add a border to an element simply, but that will change the element’s position. We could fix that problem using box sizing, but a far simpler solution is the transition in a border using an inset box shadow.
