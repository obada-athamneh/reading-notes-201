## WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS? 

* The first thing you need to do is get to know what tools are available.
You can imagine that your new toolkit has three compartments: 

1. BROWSER OBJECT MODEL 
2. DOCUMENT OBJECTMODEL
3. GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS

## THE BROWSER OBJECT MODEL: THE WINDOW OBJECT 

## USING THE BROWSER OBJECT MODEL 

## THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL: THE DOCUMENT OBJECT 

## USING THE DOCUMENT OBJECT

## GLOBAL OBJECTS: STRING O BJECT
