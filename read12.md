# The <canvas> element

**At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.**

# Fallback content

**The <canvas> element differs from an <img> tag in that, like for <video>, <audio>, or <picture> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.**

# The rendering context

**The <canvas> element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. In this tutorial, we focus on the 2D rendering context. Other contexts may provide different types of rendering**

# Basic usage

* To see how to use chart.js we’re going to create a set of 3 graphs; one will show the number of buyers a fictional product has over the course of 6 months, this will be a line chart; the second will show which countries the customers come from, this will be the pie chart; finally we’ll use a bar chart to show profit over the period.

## Drawing shapes with canvas

* Now that we have set up our canvas environment, we can get into the details of how to draw on the canvas. By the end of this article, you will have learned how to draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves, providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. Working with paths is essential when drawing objects onto the canvas and we will see how that can be done.

### The grid

### Drawing rectangles

### Drawing paths

* Now let's look at paths. A path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color. A path, or even a subpath, can be closed. To make shapes using paths, we take some extra steps:

1. First, you create the path.
2. Then you use drawing commands to draw into the path.
3. Once the path has been created, you can stroke or fill the path to render it.

## Applying styles and colors

* In the chapter about drawing shapes, we used only the default line and fill styles. Here we will explore the canvas options we have at our disposal to make our drawings a little more attractive. You will learn how to add different colors, line styles, gradients, patterns and shadows to your drawings.

### Colors

### Transparency

* In addition to drawing opaque shapes to the canvas, we can also draw semi-transparent (or translucent) shapes. This is done by either setting the globalAlpha property or by assigning a semi-transparent color to the stroke and/or fill style.


# Drawing text

## Advanced text measurements

**In the case you need to obtain more details about the text, the following method allows you to measure it**

## Gecko-specific notes

* In Gecko (the rendering engine of Firefox, Firefox OS and other Mozilla based applications), some prefixed APIs were implemented in earlier versions to draw text on a canvas. These are now deprecated and removed, and are no longer guaranteed to work.
