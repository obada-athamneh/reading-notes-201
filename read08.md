# Layout
 * In this chapter we are going to look at
how to control where each element sits
on a page and how to create attractive
page layouts.

## This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be
different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this
chapter we will:

1. Explore different ways to position elements using normal
flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
2. Discover how various devices have different screen sizes
and resolution, and how this affects the design process.
3. Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts,
and how they are created.
4. Find out how designers use grids to make their page
designs look more professional.

## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

### Building Blocks

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

### Containing Elements

* If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

## Controlling the Position of Elements

**Normal flow**
**Relative Positioning**
**Absolute positioning**

## Screen Sizes

* Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.

## Screen Resolution

* Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens

## Page Sizes

* Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

## Fixed Width Layouts

## Liquid Layouts
